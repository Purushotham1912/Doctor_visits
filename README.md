   ## Preprocessing Steps (Data_Analytics using python)

   the following preprocessing steps were applied:

   1. **Handling Missing Values**:
           Any missing values in the dataset were identified and either removed or imputed based on appropriate strategies.

   2. **Handling Duplicate Values**:
           Duplicate rows, if any, were identified and removed from the dataset.

   3. **Feature Scaling**:
           Depending on the nature of the analysis, features were scaled or standardized to ensure uniformity.

   4. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:
           If the dataset contained categorical variables, appropriate encoding techniques were applied.

   5. **Feature Engineering**:
          New features were created from existing ones to capture meaningful information.

   6. **Data Exploration**:
         Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand data distributions, relationships, and anomalies.
